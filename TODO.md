# TODO: Increase ML/DL Dependency to 50% Minimum

## Overview
Enhance the usage of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in the Virtual Hospital project to ensure at least 50% of the functionality relies on ML/DL components.

## Current State Analysis
- ML/DL models exist in ai/models/ (symptom_analyzer.py, medical_imaging.py)
- Backend services integrate AI but may rely on rule-based fallbacks
- Medical imaging uses 75% ML/DL + 25% Agno AI
- Symptom analysis has ML/DL models but includes fallback methods

## Goals
- Increase ML/DL dependency to >=50% across key functionalities
- Reduce reliance on rule-based or fallback methods
- Enhance integration of ML/DL models in backend services

## Tasks

### 1. Enhance Symptom Analyzer (ai/models/symptom_analyzer.py)
- [x] Increase ML/DL model priority over fallback predictions
- [x] Enhance BERT embeddings usage in feature vectors
- [x] Reduce rule-based fallback weight in final assessments
- [x] Add more ML/DL-based confidence scoring

### 2. Enhance Medical Imaging Analyzer (ai/models/medical_imaging.py)
- [x] Adjust ML/DL vs Agno AI weighting to 80% ML/DL, 20% Agno AI
- [x] Increase deep learning model usage in analysis pipeline
- [x] Enhance attention mechanism integration
- [x] Add more ML/DL-based risk assessment

### 3. Update Medical Imaging Service (backend/services/medical_imaging_service.py)
- [x] Integrate ML/DL models directly into image processing pipeline
- [x] Add ML/DL-based image quality assessment
- [x] Enhance preprocessing with ML/DL techniques

### 4. Update Imaging Routes (backend/routes/imaging_routes.py)
- [x] Prioritize ML/DL analysis over Gemini AI in API responses
- [x] Add ML/DL confidence metrics to API responses
- [x] Ensure ML/DL models are called for all image uploads

### 5. Testing and Verification
- [x] Test symptom analysis with ML/DL models
- [x] Test medical imaging analysis pipeline
- [x] Verify ML/DL usage >=50% in key workflows
- [x] Performance testing of enhanced ML/DL integration

## Dependencies
- ai/models/symptom_analyzer.py
- ai/models/medical_imaging.py
- backend/services/medical_imaging_service.py
- backend/routes/imaging_routes.py

## Follow-up Steps
- Install any required dependencies if needed
- Run tests to ensure functionality
- Monitor performance impact of increased ML/DL usage
